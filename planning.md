# Planning

## The purpose of this doucment is to journal my design process

I find that it's easier not to get sidetracked if I explicitly write out what I want this project to acomplish

**Input**: image from phone

**Output**: display image on e-ink with dithering

** dithering is adding intentional noise to add shading!

I'm going to write this in python bc C ptsd!

The hardware is going to be a rpi zero 2w, but I'm going to use a normal rpi 3b+ to prototype before moving onto the actual hardware
