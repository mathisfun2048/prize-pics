# Planning

## The purpose of this doucment is to journal my design process

I find that it's easier not to get sidetracked if I explicitly write out what I want this project to acomplish

**Input**: image from phone

**Output**: display image on e-ink with dithering

** dithering is adding intentional noise to add shading!


The hardware is going to be a rpi zero 2w, but I'm going to use a normal rpi 3b+ to prototype before moving onto the actual hardware

### Project structure

We need the following folders, probably (im guessing based on my prior e-ink project)

-> src to hold our code

-> config to hold our configurations

-> images to hold our images before and after

-> lib to hold our libraries

-> tests to keep my test files to make sure they work and dont crash my display!
